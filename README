The adaptive mesh refinement algorithm[1] is in AMRMesh.py file, the mesh format is .top file,
but the algorithm uses only the node list and element list. MeshQual.py read mesh file, plot several
aspect ratios[2] to qualify the mesh.

The test results of refining a cube [-1,1],[-1,1],[-1,1], at point (0.2,0.3,0.4) by 50 times is in
cube_initial_qual.png, cube_ref50_qual.png and cube_ref50.png. The algorithm is efficient and the quality
of the mesh is excellent! The aspect ratio is bounded!
